## Web crawler

A simple webcrawler for crawling links on websites. This was created using the latest create-react-app. To do this, I used a proxy I served from my heroku account (`https://saibot-no-cors.herokuapp.com/`) to avoid CORS issues. I also useed cheerio to parse html mark up.


### Prerequisite

- `git clone https://github.com/saibotlive/web-crawler.git`
- run `cd web-crawler`
- run `yarn`
- run `yarn start`
